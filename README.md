## Full-stack application for a pizzeria 
-Backend in the development process

## User story for now:
- The user enters the page, creates their pizza from scratch , adds a side dish if they want, adds the payment method and places their order.
- If the user wants to edit the order, they go to the my orders page and change the order they want to edit.

## Implementations still missing
- Login and user verification 
- Home page with information about the pizzeria and contact numbers
- Menu if the user doesn't want to create an order but wants to order one of the standard orders
- Creation of pizzas and orders by user
